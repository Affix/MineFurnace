a simple calculator to calculate your needs when forging in minecraft

Based on : http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/824008-furnacecalc-tool/

I wrote this as I don't like seeing closed source applications. I chose python for its cross platform scalability and low memory footprint

Requirements :
	Python >= 2.6
	PyGTK
	GTK >= 2.0
